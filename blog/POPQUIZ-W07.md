The Tale of young ashen-haired and beautiful witch, Elaina.

<!--truncate-->
Elaina is a young and beautiful ashen-haired witch with bright personality who is always curious about many things. Inspired by her favourite book "The Adventure of Nikke", She embarks on her journey to explore new places and meet different people from around the world and of course, to write her own journey diary.


This is simply my favourite laidback-ish adventure anime. The premise is pretty simple, the story takes place as it's like the real world, except there exist magic.

The plot started when Elaina just passed her magic exam(?) and considered as prodigy, but she couldn't find any witch who wants take her as apprentice. She then met Stardust Witch and became the apprentice for the time being. long short story, Elaina got beaten badly easily when she did sparring with her mentor, this broke Elaina and made her realized she is not that special. The story continues as a journey of Elaina where she visited many places with various lore.

Now, what i really like from Elaina is that, it's been a long time since the last time i watch pure, innocent, and normal-ish adventure anime. Ever since 2016 up until 2020, the anime was all either about isekai reincarnation or OP main character. As for the character, Elaina herself is a brave, realistic, and smart girl, or cunning i'd rather say. She was betrayed, violated, and mocked many time, but rarely cries or dwells in her suffering, rather she always try to take back what's hers eloquently and move on. This is exactly the ideal adventure character anime.

Although the anime is somewhat laidback, it actually propose a dark-ish theme of real life. Failure, betrayal, revenge, greed, dishonesty, you can find them all surrounding every places Elaina visit throughout her cheerful journey.

To conclude, Majo no tabitabi is a great adventure anime and easily a recommendation from me
